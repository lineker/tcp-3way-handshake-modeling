Script usage information:

modelcheck.sh:
  Runs spin’s model checker over a file given as argument. If no argument is
  given, runs the model checker over tcp.pml.

checkassertions.sh:
  Runs spin’s model checker over a given assertion .pml file, or a directory
  containing assertions given as argument. If no arguments is given, runs the
  model checker over all assertions in the assertions folder.

checkmutant.sh:
  Iterates over all mutants in the mutants directory. For each mutant .pml
  file, check it against each assertion .pml file in the assertions directory.
  Whenever one assertion catches the mutant, move on to the next mutant. If a
  mutant .pml file is given as argument, restricts the search that single
  mutant file.
